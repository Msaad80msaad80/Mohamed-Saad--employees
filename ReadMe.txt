First thank you for this powerful, useful and creative task , so I benefited a lot from it
Kindly Note
The task was done exactly as required without adding validations except  basic validations ASAP, as it was not explicitly requested in Email, therefore Project Should run Correctly
The dates I used as in the explanation attached to the email and have the form “yyyy-mm-ss”,  not American format, and file should .txt
With the project, model a file that I did the test on  it, and his name is example.txt
Used  Technology & Tools and IDE : ASP.NET C# (Web Forms), Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (The project is upgradable)
Thank you
